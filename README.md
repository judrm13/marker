# Automark

Utilities to help automate code testing, and interfacing with the platform used to submit code. Currently, the following are supported:

- Canvas
- MarkUs


This package installs the following scripts:

- `lms-download`: Downloads files from the given LMS.
- `prepare`: Copies needed files into student directories, compiles code.
- `automark`: Runs all the test cases, creates logs and compiles marks.
- `lms-upload-marks`: Uploads the student marks to the LMS.
- `lms-upload-reports`: Uploads the testing logs to the LMS for the student.

## How to install

You can install these scripts with `pip` (or `pip3`) with the following:

```sh
pip3 install automark 
```

Make sure you have the default installation location of `pip` in your `PATH` to be able to use the scripts directly.
